There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > hackalope.io -> a coding resource review site.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Coder reviews and recommendations on programming resources.

## Summary ##
  > While there are numerous coding resources available, it is often difficult to find resources which specifically meet your learning needs without relentless googling. With hackalope.io, our objective is to make that process more efficient by compiling resources, submitted and rated by fellow programmers. 

## Problem ##
  > There is an overabundance of coding resources/documentation. Hackalope.io aims to help the coders efficiently find the best resources to suit their needs. 

## Solution ##
  > This app compiles coding resources submitted by programmers and allows users to rate and comment on their usefulness. This makes it easy for programmers to find resources that fit their needs.

## Quote from You ##
  > "All of us at Hackalope started learning to code on our own. In doing so, we found some really great resources, but also lost a lot of time working with not-so-great ones. We created Hackalope because it's the kind of site we wish we had when we were getting started. Happy hacking!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Search by language and topics to find the best resources for your programming needs! If you want to contribute to the site, just create an account. You'll be able to submit and save resources, vote on resources submitted by other users, and leave your feedback on resources you have used.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I love Hackalope! It's the first place I go when I need to learn something new. Just this week I was trying to develop my chops in React. Hackalope pointed me to a lot of great resources after one quick search." --Nathan Turinski, Software Engineer 

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Go to hackalope.io to get started!
